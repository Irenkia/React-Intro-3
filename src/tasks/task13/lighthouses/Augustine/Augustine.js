        <p>
            <br>St. Augustine was home to the first lighthouse in Florida, </br>
            <br> though the first structure fell into the ocean after </br>
            <br>its foundation eroded. The newer, current lighthouse was </br>
            <br>constructed on Anastasia Island and completed in 1874.</br>
            <br>The building received indoor plumbing in 1907 and the  </br>
            <br>light was electrified in 1936 and automated in 1955.</br>
            <br>After lighthouse keepers were no longer needed, the </br>
            <br>keeperâ€™s house began to be rented out to local residents.</br>
